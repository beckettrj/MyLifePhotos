# Contributing to MyLifePictures.ai

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MyLifePictures.ai! This project aims to improve the lives of elderly users through compassionate AI technology.

## üéØ Project Mission

MyLifePictures.ai is designed specifically for elderly users in care facilities, focusing on:
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AAA compliance with elderly-specific optimizations

### 2. Accessibility Contributions

We prioritize accessibility for elderly users:

#### Design Requirements
- **Font Size**: Minimum 18px, prefer 20px+ for primary content
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for all interactive elements
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AAA compliance (7:1 ratio)
- **Motion**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` settings

#### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation without mouse
- [ ] High contrast mode functionality
- [ ] Voice command integration
- [ ] Large font mode readability

### 3. AI & Voice Contributions

#### AI Provider Integration
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
- Graceful fallback between providers
- Context-aware responses for elderly users
- Safety filtering for inappropriate content

#### Voice Command Enhancement
- Natural language processing improvements
- Emergency keyword detection
- Multi-language support planning
- Noise reduction and clarity improvements

## üåü Special Considerations

### Elderly User Focus
Remember that our primary users are elderly individuals who may have:
- Limited technology experience
- Vision or hearing impairments
- Reduced motor skills
- Memory challenges
- Preference for simple, predictable interfaces

Every contribution should consider these factors and prioritize user dignity and independence.

### Family and Caregiver Experience
Secondary users (family members and caregivers) need:
- Easy setup and configuration
- Clear monitoring and notification systems
- Simple photo upload and organization
- Peace of mind about their loved one's experience
